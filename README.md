# Syntax Highlighting for [PostCSS]

<img src="https://postcss.github.io/postcss/logo.svg" title="Philosopher’s stone, logo of PostCSS" align="right" width="95" height="95">

PostCSS syntax highlighting for Sublime Text. 

* Support CSS-like syntax and [SugarSS] syntax.
* Support for CSS custom properties `var(--variable-name)` and `--variable-name`, and dollar variables `$variable`;
* Automatic enable syntax highlighting for `*.pcss` and `*.postcss` files (CSS-like syntax), and for `*.sss` (SugarSS);

There is a lot of possible improvements can be made to this syntax, but frankly, I don't understand in syntax files much and hope for the help of the community.

## Installation

Install with [Package Control].

Open the Command Palette `Cmd+Shift+P` (OS X) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Linux/Windows) and select “Package Control: Install Package”, then search for `Syntax Highlighting for PostCSS`.
